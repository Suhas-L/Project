# What Are Student Management Systems?
A student management system (also known as a student information system or SIS) helps a school manage data, communications, and scheduling. A school system generates and uses a large amount of data. This data must be communicated appropriately to students, faculty, and parents. A student management system helps schools to store, manage, and distribute this information.

Some student management systems are designed to serve all of a schoolâ€™s student data management needs. Other student management systems are specialized. These specialized solutions target specific needs, such as school applications or student behavior tracking.

Student management systems provide many benefits to educational institutions, mostly stemming from centralized data management and accessibility. Teachers can more easily input, manage, and access student data. Parental guardians get better visibility into how their student is performing in classes. State-level compliance and other regulatory requirements are also much easier to fulfill.

The education system has constantly been evolving, hence to keep up with new channels of education we need to evolve our system to store information by automating the traditional ways and bringing more structure to the curriculum.
To manage enormous amount of data, it becomes important to include a managing tool to your School. A Student Management System is solution to all the requirements a school work on. Various features like admission, attendance, fee collection library, examination, timetable, student performance report etc.

# When:
   The earliest management system for schools was developed in 1978 by Raymond Bily while he was a student at Asheville High School, in Asheville, NC.
   It was initially developed by Philip Neal, a teacher at Lea Manor High School, from # 1982 to 1983.
   Bedfordshire County Council (Lea Manor's local education authority) then further developed the product, which began being used by other schools in 1984.
   In 1988, a commercial company, SIMS Ltd, was founded to further develop SIMS.SIMS Ltd was acquired by Capita Group in 1994.
   In December 2020, Capita decided to sell their Education Software Solutions business (whose flagship product is SIMS) to private equity house Montagu in an effort to reduce debts. Montagu have stated that they intend to continue developing SIMS with a plan to release the latest version, SIMS 8, after the acquisition process has completed.

# Where:
   Schools,Colleges,Tution Centres and Universities in almost all technologically developing and developed nations.
 
# How:
   Administrating staffs in Schools,Colleges,Tution Centres and Universities will maintain all records regarding students with the help of this system through PC's.
