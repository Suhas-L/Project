# What Are Student Management Systems?
A student management system (also known as a student information system or SIS) helps a school manage data, communications, and scheduling. A school system generates and uses a large amount of data. This data must be communicated appropriately to students, faculty, and parents. A student management system helps schools to store, manage, and distribute this information.

Some student management systems are designed to serve all of a schoolâ€™s student data management needs. Other student management systems are specialized. These specialized solutions target specific needs, such as school applications or student behavior tracking.

Student management systems provide many benefits to educational institutions, mostly stemming from centralized data management and accessibility. Teachers can more easily input, manage, and access student data. Parental guardians get better visibility into how their student is performing in classes. State-level compliance and other regulatory requirements are also much easier to fulfill.
